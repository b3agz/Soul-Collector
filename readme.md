# Soul Collector - Game Programming Basics Project

## About This Project

This "Coin Collector" game is a project created for the "Game Programming Basics" module (4FSCOPE001) at SAE Institute, as part of a BSc in Games Programming. The goal of the project was to create a simple game demonstrating a foundational understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, loops, and vector maths.

No external assets were used and built-in functions were intentionally replicated for educational purposes.

The game was developed in Unity 6 and coded in C#. This readme also serves as a basic game design document.

## Gameplay

The player controls a small ghost character within a series of simple mazes. The objective is to collect all the floating "souls" in each level to progress to the next.

* **Controls:** Use WASD, Arrow Keys, or joypad analogue stick to move the character one square at a time.

## Assignment Constraints

This project was created under a specific set of constraints designed to focus on core programming skills:

* **No External Assets:** All visuals are created using the engine's built-in primitive shapes (cubes, spheres, capsules).
* **Simple Materials:** Only basic, solid in-engine material colours.
* **Manual Maths Functions:** Core mathematical functions, such as the LERP for player movement, were implemented manually to demonstrate understanding.
* **No AI Assistance:** All code and logic were written entirely by the developer without the use of generative AI tools.
